# TMDB Plugin

A WordPress plugin that integrates with [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to bring movie and TV series data to your site.

## Current features
- Registers dedicated custom post types for movies, series, seasons, episodes, actors, genres, tags, and directors.
- Provides relationship meta boxes so that each season is linked to a single series and episodes are always tied to the correct series and season.
- Adds an introductory admin page that outlines the upcoming functionality and gives administrators a starting point.

## Getting started
1. Copy the plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate **TMDB Plugin** from the WordPress admin dashboard.
3. Open the new **TMDB Plugin** menu item to review the introduction and roadmap for future features.

More capabilities—such as API credential management, widgets, and caching—will be added as the plugin evolves.
